# Competitive Programming Workspace

This is the competitive programming workspace that I use.

## Initializing / resetting the workspace

Run the `init` script.

## Starting the editor

Run the `launch` script.

## Solving a problem

For instance, assume you use `src/a.cpp`.

- Run `./run a` or <kbd>F10</kbd> in NeoVim to run the program.
- Run `./clip a` or <kbd>F9</kbd> in NeoVim to copy the program for submitting.
